### 1. Research on the Influence of Social Media upon the Stock Market Based on Data Mining Technology

Analysed and predicted the stock market using big data from social media by means of web crawler technology, text mining technology, machine learning algorithms, and econometric methods. Applied natural language processing and sentiment analysis to handle unstructured social media texts and build an emotion index. Using linear regression and neural network in deep learning, it empirically studied stock market performance, continuously monitored social media's impact, and provided investment advice and forecasts based on social media fluctuations.

### 2. Sino-Russian Geoscience Field Expedition and Research Program at Lake Baikal

Participated in a Sino-Russian geoscience field study at Lake Baikal, conducting research on Chinese tourists' spatial-temporal distribution via big data crawling, text analytics, and GIS mapping to assess tourism capacity and development needs.

## Key Findings

### Social Media and Stock Market Research
- Machine learning algorithms achieved 88% accuracy in sentiment analysis, far exceeding traditional sentiment dictionary methods
- Social media sentiment indices show significant negative correlation with stock market volatility
- LSTM neural networks outperform traditional linear regression models in stock prediction
- Social media sentiment demonstrates short-term predictive capability for stock markets

### Lake Baikal Tourism Research
- Chinese tourist numbers have grown significantly, but local tourism capacity is insufficient
- Irkutsk serves as a crucial transit hub in tourism development
- Lagging infrastructure development is the main constraint on tourism growth
- Need to balance tourism development with environmental protection
